//  a
// Flutter is a programming framework developed by google for the purpose of compiling mobile, desktop and web applications. 
// It is supported through open source.


// b
//  Since Flutter is cross platform, one can develop mobile applications for both Android and iOS using a singular codebase.
//  Flutter has a hot reload feature that instantly reflects code changes without the need of restarting the application which enables faster development. 
//  Flutter enables integration with platform-specific features through plugins and platform channels.

//c
//  Dart is an open-source language programming language developed by Google. It is utilised in application development on both the client and server sides using Flutter.
//  Reasons:
//  Dart can compile both ahead-of-time (AOT) for enhanced performance and just-in-time (JIT) for faster development cycles.
//  Dart has a major advantageous support for synchronous programming with functionality like async and await, which enables it to handlle tasks like file operations, and network requests effectively.
//  Dart comes along with vast libraries and tools that are intergrated with flutter.

//d
// Hot reloading enables a developer to view changes whilst the app is running. It syncs newer versions of the files that you edited at runtime upon pressing the r button shortcut.. It leverages HMR and without reloading the page.
// It replaces changed components in-place while preserving state, which enables quick debugging, and instant visualisation of updated code-base.

//e
//  Variety of pre-built  widgets to choose from, which enhances customisation.
//  Cross-Platform Development, a singlular codebase for both Android and iOS which saves on resources.
//  Flutter compiles to native machine code, which is similar to a native app built independentlyfor each platform.

//f
// A stateful widget is dynamic by nature. It's appearance in changed in response to events triggered by user interactions or any other factors.
// Eg. Checkbox that changes its state when clicked
// A steless widget is static in nature. Once created, the properties cannot change.
